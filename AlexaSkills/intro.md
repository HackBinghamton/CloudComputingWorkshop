**Introduction**
In this section, we'll go over what Alexa skills are with some examples. Then we'll provide a tutorial for making your own Alexa skill!

## What is an Alexa skill?
Amazon Alexa is the voice service available on Amazon's home devices. It's a smart assistant, like Siri on Apple devices and Google Assistant on Google home devices. A home device is something like an Echo or a Google Home. Alexa skills are the different things Alexa can do. Think of Alexa skills as the apps for a home device. For example, there is a Spotify Alexa skill that enables you to stream music from your device.

To make this happen, first you need to speak the wake word, which is "Alexa" by default. Now the home device starts to listen for your command. Following our example, you would say "Alexa, play Spotify." This triggers the Spotify skill to begin, and in this case play music.
## What if I don't have an Alexa enabled device?
**YOU DO NOT NEED AN ALEXA ENABLED DEVICE TO MAKE A SKILL!**
While it would be more fun to use your skill on your own Amazon device, owning one is not a requirement. When you test your skill on the Alexa Developer Console, you can either speak to your browser or type what you want to say to Alexa, then you will hear the response from your browser. So you could create a skill and fully test it without owning an Alexa!

If you don't have an Alexa enabled device and you think developing Alexa skills is really cool, an Echo Dot is only $40 and goes on sale every once in awhile for even cheaper. Not sponsored, but we just wanted to let you know they are rather cheap.
## What can Alexa skills do?
Alexa can do almost any skill you can think of! Some Alexa enabled devices even have cameras so those can be utilized in skills too, which opens up even more possibilities! Here's a short list of Alexa skills and what they do:

 - "Alexa, what time does Chipotle close?" - tells you when your local Chipotle closes.
 - "Alexa, play Jeopardy." - begins a game of Jeopardy for you to play via voice interaction with her.
 - "Alexa, open My Pet Rock." - opens the My Pet Rock skill, where you can take care of your own pet rock.
 - "Alexa, start a timer for 30 minutes." - sets a timer for 30 minutes (shocker!).
 - "Alexa, what's the weather?" - gives weather forecast at your current location.
 - "Alexa, what should I make for dinner tonight?" - suggests something to eat for dinner.
 - "Alexa, add CS 301 presentation to my to do list." - puts "CS 301 presentation" on your to do list on the Amazon Alexa app.

As you can see, Alexa skills can be used for fun, productivity, lifestyle, and more! Notice the way each invocation is structured. We'll take a look at that more later.
## Let's get started!
The Amazon documentation for making basic Alexa skills is thorough and is very similar to how we typically format HackBU workshops. Here is the [link](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-python-first-skill/tree/master/module-1) to Amazon's guide on making a basic Alexa skill. At the bottom, the guide links to the next module in their documentation. There are four total modules, so make sure to check them all out!
